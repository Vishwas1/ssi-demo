## Verifiable Data Registry

This component is acts as a storage for DIDs, DID docs, schema etc. Currently its a sqlite database (basically acting as a model for this project), but can be switched to other distributed systems like blockchain. 

Note: This component should ideally be taken out and implemented as seperated module itself.
